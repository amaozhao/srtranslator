00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,600
 Welcome to our first practical video on QA. Over the next couple of videos, we're going to focus on setup.

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:15,360
 And the first piece of setup is that we need an API key. And we're going to use the OpenAI.

3
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:24,160
 So let me just Google OpenAI API. And this is an overview. We need to come to platform.openai.

4
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:34,560
 You need to log in. Creating an account is absolutely free, but you do need to log in in order to get an API key.

5
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:43,760
 Let me log in for myself. And I'm going to show you how to generate an API key.

6
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:52,320
 Overall, it can still happen that you have a free tier. That's definitely a possibility.

7
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:59,120
 But overall, what we're going to do throughout this course is not going to cost you more than one US dollar.

8
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:04,640
 With the caveat that the minimum that you can do is like five US dollars for credit.

9
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:15,600
 But it seriously is less than one US dollar. And okay, let me figure this one out as I always lose myself here.

10
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:21,920
 Because this platform is just getting bigger and bigger. And okay, I would say dashboard.

11
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:34,000
 API keys. And then to create an API key, you click on create. Let me name it as, you know, AI agent.

12
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,960
 And I'm just going to give it all permissions. It should be your account as well. So this should be okay.

13
00:01:41,679 --> 00:01:49,039
 Now it's very important that you copy this. This is going to be the last time that this is shown.

14
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,480
 It's just here once. So you need to copy and store it as a secret somewhere.

15
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:01,440
 And for us, in case that you have not, I would encourage that you download the AI agents folder.

16
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:11,680
 And we go to crew AI job interview prep part one. And we're going to click on new more and then Google

17
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:20,480
 Collaboratory. And from here we can kick it off. And what I'm going to do here, I click on copy.

18
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:27,040
 And like I have already quite a bit, but let me add another secret here. You can see that I have been

19
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:36,880
 working on this. Let me, I'm going to call it AI agents, open AI. Right. So this will be a key that

20
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:45,600
 I'm going to use specifically for this course. I do control V to paste it here. And let me in a sense

21
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:53,440
 hide it here. And then the last piece that one would do. So you click here and this is going to

22
00:02:54,240 --> 00:03:01,680
 get here the code in order to get a specific API key. And for instance, I would come here, AI agents,

23
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:15,120
 open AI and I would store it under something. So let's say open AI, API key equals to this open

24
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:28,880
 AI API key. And let me just add here. So we'll focus it on setup. And the very basic of things

25
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:34,720
 would be okay. Contra enter and let me come here to secrets at the same time. Currently it's

26
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:40,160
 connecting to the script, but you see here notebook access. It's not what is happening is that all of

27
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:46,560
 these secrets, they're passed from one notebook to the other, but you do need to activate for that

28
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:53,440
 specific notebook. In this case is going to prompt you grant access, which you come to grant access.

29
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:01,760
 And then I can see I took way too long. It's okay. I do control enter and here we go. So now we have

30
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:11,440
 the open AI API key, which is absolutely ready to go. And with this, I'm going to stop this video.

31
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:27,120
 Let me just give it a title here. So crew AI job interview prep part one. Here we go. And that is

32
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,320
 it. So I'll see you in the next video.
